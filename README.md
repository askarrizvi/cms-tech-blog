  ## Description
  The challenge for this week involves building a blog site for tech blogs. This involves building Sequelize models for the different tables, encrypting the user passwords, setting up a logged in user session and setting up the Express routes that will either read or modify the database depending on the REST API calls. The app follows the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars as the templating language.
